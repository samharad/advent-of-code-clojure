;; [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/20) involves grids. We're given
;; a binary "photo", the bottom grid below, and an "enhancement algorithm", the
;; initial long binary string.

;; The image below is actually infinite; we assume that the infinite grid
;; of surrounding pixels are all dark, i.e. `.`.

;; We repeatedly "enhance" our image pixel-by-pixel by first taking
;; the 3-by-3 grid of pixels centered on our target pixel, concatenating
;; these 3 rows, converting that into a binary number, and then using that
;; number to index into our "enhancement algorithm", which is just an array.

;; (The [puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/20) does a better job of
;; explaining.)

;; our infinite image is dark at the perimeter. It starts out dark, but it may be
;; that our enhancement algorithm maps a grid of all-dark pixels to a light
;; pixel, meaning that the perimeter of our image will flash entirely to light.
;; It may also map a grid of all-light pixels to a dark pixel, in which case
;; successive enhancements of the image will "flash" at the perimeters.
